<h2>Observations</h2>


<p>this is a <strong>Jyotisha chart</strong> also known as <strong>Vedic astrology</strong> which is an <strong>Indian system of astrology</strong> that uses <strong>Ayanamsa Lahiri</strong>, being different from the traditional western astrology, so it is possible to have differences in signs between these two methodologies.</p>
